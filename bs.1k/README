We tested if using 1000 bootsrap iterations changes the results.

First, we computed 1000 bootstrap for an every gene tree (subm.sh,
tree1k.sh).

Then we computed bootstrap support using these 1000 trees (combine.ds)
and finally exported bootstrap values (export_bootstrap_values.py) and
analyzed with comp.R.

The plot is in bootstrap_100_vs_1k.pdf. Correlation is high (r=0.997).

Confusion matrix for 95 threshold:

       bs1k
bs100    FALSE   TRUE
  FALSE 151417    324
  TRUE     471  10489
